                    packs a serious punch while maintaining a very respectable speed. Driving down the Autobahn has never been so fun, just make sure you don't

                    The Ratte comes in at 1000 tonnes (!), has a top speed of 40km/h, and has a main turret the size of an actual tank. This house-size
                    monster of a tank guarantees no BMW driver will overtake you from the right, seeing as you will be occupying the entire highway.

                    Probably the exact opposite of the Ratte, the Scorpion embodies speed and smolness like no other. With a recorded top speed of
                    82km/h, and weighing only 8 tonnes, the difference between this and a Nissan is negligible. You think your son wants to go with
